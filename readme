Usage

The templates directory of this project is designed to be used in conjunction
with a particular font project. There are a few ways of associating this
templates directory with a font project.

1. use the command svn co
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates to
pull in the latest version of the templates into your project.

2. If you are already managing your font project using svn then you can use
the command svn setprop svn:externals "templates
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates"
which will tell svn to pull in the templates directory from the given
repository and keep it up to date from there.

3. svn co
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates
../templates and keep the templates directory in a different location than as
templates under the root of the font project. This works on all systems,
except that it will break make dist under Windows (since Windows can't make
the necessary symbolic link to the directory needed to put the template files
in the distribution bundle).
