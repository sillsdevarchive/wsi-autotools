Usage

The templates directory of this project is designed to be used in conjunction
with a particular font project. There are a few ways of associating this
templates directory with a font project.

1. use the command svn co
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates to
pull in the latest version of the templates into your project.

2. If you are already managing your font project using svn then you can use
the command svn setprop svn:externals "templates
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates"
which will tell svn to pull in the templates directory from the given
repository and keep it up to date from there.

3. svn co
http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/utilities/font-package/trunk/templates
../templates and keep the templates directory in a different location than as
templates under the root of the font project. This works on all systems,
except that it will break make dist under Windows (since Windows can't make
the necessary symbolic link to the directory needed to put the template files
in the distribution bundle).

Debian packaging

This system will create a debian-src/ directory that is designed to be copied
as a debian/ directory for packaging purposes. make dist creates a tarball of
all the key files, but for portability purposes it does not head the tree
inside the tarball with the package and version. So to build one needs to:

create a build directory
create package-version subdir of build
cd package-version
tar xvzf distribution.tar.gz
cd ..
tar cvzf package_version.orig.tar.gz package-version
cd package-version
cp -r debian-src debian
pdebuild or whatever to build the package

Perhaps I need to put the head dir in the tarball. Hmm.
